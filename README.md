#　Shell　Config　Setup

## Summary
This script is a program that takes care of the initial setup that you often do. The setup includes the installation of GUI applications, which are installed automatically. macOS and Windows versions are available. There are also two patterns: one for general users and one for developers.

Since it was created for my own use, I think updates will be modest.
